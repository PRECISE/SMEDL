The purpose of this example is to illustrate construction and operation of parametric checkers.

meander.c is a program with two threads, each of which counts up to an upper bound, then switches and counts down to a lower bound.

The property of each thread, captured by meander.smedl, is that as soon as a bound is reached, the switch will occur.  The program is correct with respect to this spec; the goal is to consider instrumentation and instantiation of monitors.

meander.pedl describes the instrumentation for meander.c.  In addition to defining events used in the SMEDL model, it also specifies parameterization of the checker.

meander-instrumented.c shows where instrumentation would be applied in the meander program.  We should discuss with Grammatech, how this instrumentation can be implemented with Sysense.

finally, safemon.c is a complete instantiation of the checker in C, including a naive implementation of parametric event routing.

To compile the programs:

original:
gcc meander.c -o meander -lpthread

monitored:
gcc meander-instrumented.c safemon.c -o meander-monitored -lpthread
