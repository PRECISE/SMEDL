- Add checker lookup functions to auto-generation
- Have explorer_mon.h auto-generated
- Make thread-local variables for storing monitor ID so we can access it from anywhere in the program

- Add destructor for monitor
- Support labels for internal state variables and external state variables

- Record decisions that we have made!!!!
    - raising of events with event containing an attribute can be handled two ways: with update of state variable, and with implicit helper function return value

- NEXT!: Make list of all SMEDL design decisions and discuss at next meeting

- Search for source code instrumentation tools (or binary-level tools)

- Build PEDL symbol table and include some consistency checks against the SMEDL symbol table
- Ensure all manual code edits are generated automatically

Instrumentation example:

int foo() {
    int temp = bar();
    checker_update_here
    return temp;
}

int temp = bar();
checker_update_here

bar();

Add all loop transitions to multi.smedl and add extra cases to _mon
Change scan_view function with contains_object function call
set view action on scan_view event
contains_object function just takes in map and checks view already set
make cleared function

add prefix to monitor function and var names to avoid conflict

struct internal variable and struct parameters for helpers
